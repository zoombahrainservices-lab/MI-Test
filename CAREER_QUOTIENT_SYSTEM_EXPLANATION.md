# Career Mapping & Quotient Profile System

## 🎯 Overview

The Multiple Intelligences (MI) Test system uses advanced algorithms to provide personalized career guidance and workplace quotient profiles based on Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Intelligence Assessment
- **64 Questions**: Users answer questions on a 1-5 Likert scale
- **8 Intelligence Types**: Logical, Linguistic, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Spatial, Musical, Bodily, Naturalist
- **Scoring**: Raw scores are normalized to percentages (0-100%)
- **Result**: User's strength profile across all intelligences

### 2. Quotient Profile Calculation

The system calculates **5 Workplace Quotients** by combining related intelligences:

#### 🧮 IQ (Intelligence Quotient) - 82%
- **Formula**: (Logical + Linguistic) ÷ 2
- **Calculation**: (83% + 80%) ÷ 2 = 82%
- **Description**: Analytical and verbal reasoning abilities
- **Workplace Value**: Problem-solving, data analysis, communication

#### 💝 EQ (Emotional Quotient) - 66%
- **Formula**: (Interpersonal + Intrapersonal) ÷ 2
- **Calculation**: (72% + 60%) ÷ 2 = 66%
- **Description**: Emotional intelligence and self-awareness
- **Workplace Value**: Leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution

#### 🔄 AQ (Adaptability Quotient) - 28%
- **Formula**: (Bodily + Naturalist) ÷ 2
- **Calculation**: (32% + 24%) ÷ 2 = 28%
- **Description**: Physical and environmental adaptability
- **Workplace Value**: Change management, physical tasks, environmental awareness

#### 🎨 CQ (Creative Quotient) - 44%
- **Formula**: (Spatial + Musical) ÷ 2
- **Calculation**: (48% + 40%) ÷ 2 = 44%
- **Description**: Creative and artistic abilities
- **Workplace Value**: Design, innovation, artistic expression

#### ✨ SQ (Spiritual Quotient) - 30%
- **Formula**: (Existential + Intrapersonal) ÷ 2
- **Calculation**: (0% + 60%) ÷ 2 = 30%
- **Description**: Spiritual awareness and meaning-making
- **Workplace Value**: Purpose-driven work, ethical decision-making

### 3. Career Mapping Algorithm

Each career has **predefined intelligence weights** that determine how important each intelligence is for success in that field.

#### Example: Data Scientist
- **Logical**: 35% weight → 83% × 35% = 29% contribution
- **Linguistic**: 15% weight → 80% × 15% = 12% contribution
- **Intrapersonal**: 20% weight → 60% × 20% = 12% contribution
- **Spatial**: 10% weight → 48% × 10% = 5% contribution
- **Interpersonal**: 10% weight → 72% × 10% = 7% contribution
- **Total Match**: 68%

#### Example: Teacher/Educator
- **Linguistic**: 30% weight → 80% × 30% = 24% contribution
- **Interpersonal**: 30% weight → 72% × 30% = 22% contribution
- **Intrapersonal**: 20% weight → 60% × 20% = 12% contribution
- **Logical**: 10% weight → 83% × 10% = 8% contribution
- **Total Match**: 70%

### 4. Career Database

The system includes **20+ careers** with detailed mappings:

| Career | Top Intelligences | Match % | Salary Range | Education |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Financial Advisor | Logical (30%), Interpersonal (25%) | 72% | $40k-$150k+ | Bachelor's in Finance |
| Journalist/Writer | Linguistic (40%), Intrapersonal (20%) | 71% | $30k-$80k | Bachelor's in Journalism |
| Teacher/Educator | Linguistic (30%), Interpersonal (30%) | 70% | $40k-$80k | Bachelor's in Education |
| Marketing Manager | Interpersonal (25%), Linguistic (25%) | 70% | $50k-$130k | Bachelor's in Marketing |
| HR Manager | Interpersonal (35%), Linguistic (20%) | 70% | $50k-$120k | Bachelor's in HR |
| Business Analyst | Logical (30%), Linguistic (20%) | 70% | $55k-$110k | Bachelor's in Business |
| Psychologist/Counselor | Interpersonal (40%), Intrapersonal (30%) | 69% | $45k-$100k | Master's in Psychology |
| Doctor/Physician | Logical (25%), Intrapersonal (25%) | 69% | $150k-$400k+ | Medical Degree |
| Data Scientist | Logical (35%), Intrapersonal (20%) | 68% | $70k-$150k | Bachelor's in Computer Science |

## 🎯 Personalized Recommendations

### Top 3 Intelligences
1. **Logical** (83%) - Strong analytical thinking
2. **Linguistic** (80%) - Excellent communication skills
3. **Interpersonal** (72%) - Great with people

### Quotient Profile
- **IQ**: 82% - High analytical and verbal abilities
- **EQ**: 66% - Good emotional intelligence
- **CQ**: 44% - Moderate creative abilities
- **AQ**: 28% - Lower adaptability quotient
- **SQ**: 30% - Developing spiritual awareness

### Career Recommendations
1. **Financial Advisor** (72%) - Leverages logical and interpersonal skills
2. **Journalist/Writer** (71%) - Uses linguistic and intrapersonal strengths
3. **Teacher/Educator** (70%) - Combines linguistic and interpersonal abilities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Formula
```
Career Match % = Σ(User Intelligence % × Career Weight) ÷ Σ(Career Weights)
```

### Intelligence Categories
- **Analytical**: Logical, Linguistic → IQ
- **Emotional**: Interpersonal, Intrapersonal → EQ
- **Physical**: Bodily, Naturalist → AQ
- **Creative**: Spatial, Musical → CQ
- **Spiritual**: Existential, Intrapersonal → SQ
