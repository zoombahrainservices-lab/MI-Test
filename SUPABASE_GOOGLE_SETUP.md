http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

2. **Test Google Sign-in**
   - Click the Google button
   - You'll be redirected to Google's OAuth page
   - After authentication, you'll be redirected back to your app

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If you get "Invalid redirect URI" error:**
- Check that the redirect URI in Google Console exactly matches: `https://xfsakpxluorfhumjopgp.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**If you get "Client ID not found" error:**
- Verify the Client ID is correct in Supabase
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
